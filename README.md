# Hotel

#### 7/25/2018
Roughly a month ago (actually exactly a month ago) my wife and I returned from vacationing in Ecuador, South America. While there, we went to a beach called Ayampe for a few days and stayed at a wonderful little hotel within walking distance from the ocean called La Buena Vida (The Good Life).

During our stay in Ayampe, I met a Spaniard by the name of Juan (surprise surprise) who at some point in the recent past had worked as a software developer, but was now taking some time off to travel around different parts of the globe.

Juan spoke positively of the times he was able to work remotely. Even now, as he travels, he carries his laptop wherever he goes, and can be seen at times pounding at the keyboard whilst staring thoughtfully into the screen. It turns out, for the duration of his stay, Juan had been helping the owners of the hotel with the website's maintenance.

Being interested in entering the field of software development, I'm constantly looking for ideas for projects which I might build to showcase my skills. It occurred to me, then, that building a website for a hypothetical hotel might be both fun and worth the undertaking.

So, this is the record of my attempt to do just that.
